# space-theme-project
This was my "Big Project" submission for my CE152 Java Programming module for Comp. Sci. degree

There is about a quarter of it missing due to some lost dependancies like map data that I am unable to get back unfortunately. But there is a Rocketship inventory generator/weight calculator, a crew generator/sorter, and my personal favourite; a solar system simulator.
